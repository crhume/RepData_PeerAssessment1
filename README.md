#Contents of Repo

In addition to the original contents of the repo, I have also added 

1. An update to the PA1_template.Rmd file
2. The produced PA1_template.html file
3. Activity.csv (unzipped)
4. This new README.md file
 

All information should be legible directly from the PA1_template.Rmd file

One difference between my graphs and those that most will do is that I thouroughly despised the interval notation of 0-2355 with huge gaps due to the misconstrual of numeric data with time data.  In order to fix this, I restructured the "interval" columns to read 0-287 (the number of 5 minute intervals up to the beginning of that time interval).  This made me much happier with the overall appearance, since intervals like 1155-1200 which seemed to be 45 long (but were, in fact only 5 long) no longer interfered with my graphical information.

The time series itself should be identical but the axis labels will read 0-287 rather than 0-2355.

Thanks, enjoy!
